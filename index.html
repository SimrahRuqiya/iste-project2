                    <p>In July 2024, five student-built capsules withstood scorching heat while reentering Earth's atmosphere in a second Kentucky ReEntry Probe Experiment called KREPE2. The researchers are still processing the data derived from the KREPE2 experiments, but their findings could sharpen the features of heat shields that would protect the space crafts during their return to Earth.</p>
