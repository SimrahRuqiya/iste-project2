        <p>Earth is our home planet and is one of the two planets within the habitable zone. This planet is relatively unique as there aren't many planets that are capable of sustaining life. Our planet contains 7 major and 8 minor tectonic plates. While our atmosphere is composed of 78% Nitrogen and 21% Oxygen both of which are fundamental to the growth of organisms on our planet.</p>
