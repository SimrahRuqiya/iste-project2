        <p>A <b>black hole</b> is considered a region in space where gravity pulls so strongly, not even light can get through it. The formation of black holes occurs when big stars die and, because of their immense weight, collapse under their very own gravitational pull. When the fuel of a star is burned up, its core may not be able to support itself anymore and collapse into a singularity-a point in space where gravitational pull is infinitely strong and it is infinitely dense. The boundary around that singularity beyond which nothing can ever escape is called the event horizon.</p>

        <p>They range in size from stellar black holes, produced by the collapse of individual stars, to supermassive black holes found at the center of most galaxies, our own Milky Way included. These supermassive black holes can have masses of up to millions or even billions of times that of the Sun. The processes of formation of supermassive black holes are also very actively investigated. Supermassive black holes could have formed through mergers of smaller ones or through the accretion of large quantities of gas over long periods of time.</p>
        <br><p>Such invisible black holes are detectable, for instance, by the influence they have on the surrounding matter. It might be that a black hole forms part of a binary system, where another star regularly feels the gravitational pull of a black hole into which it gets pulled, emitting X-rays when the material heats up and gets accreted. In such a way, the gravitational pull exerted by a black hole takes the form of the motion of nearby stars or gas clouds.</p>
        <br><p>The study of black holes actually aids our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature but challenges our understanding of physics, especially where gravity and quantum mechanics intersect. Black holes are an object of wonder and mystery, driving a great deal of astronomical research.</p>
